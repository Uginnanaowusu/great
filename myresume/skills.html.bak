<p> I am a good communicator, its one of the skills I acquired wi
hile doing my National service. Mostly personnels come with coplaint and most of the time i am to assure them that things will 
be taken care off. Also, am able to relate to customers well due to my communication skills.

<p>Paying attention to details is one of my hallmark. To succeed, you need to pay attention to details
and to note down things that will be beneficial to your work.</p>

<p>What is the difference between skills and qualities?
We each have a unique set of personal attributes that is made up of different behaviours, traits, skills and qualities. These attributes help make us who we are, influence the things we enjoy and what we are good (and not so good) at.

The difference between skills and qualities is that one is acquired, and the other we are born with.

A skill requires learning, often acquired through specialist training and knowledge. It can be loosely defined as the ‘what’ we can do well. A quality, on the other hand, is more about ‘who’ we are as a person.

We talk more about the definitions of skills and qualities below. 
Who we are has a significant influence on what we do and how we do things. Our qualities are the inherent parts of our character that naturally determine our social behaviours, working and learning styles, the things we are most interested in and those we are good at. And because skills are learned and developed over time, our qualities will naturally have an impact on how we build our individual skillset; skills and qualities are therefore inextricably linked.
